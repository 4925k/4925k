# Hi there!

Currently on my Training Arc 2024 where I have planned to learn a little every day including but not limited to AWS SA, DevOps (Docker + Kubernetes) and Advanced Algorihtms (Neetcode + Leetcode). 

I'm a passionate Backend Golang Engineer with 4 years of experience under my belt. I thrive on crafting robust, efficient, and scalable solutions, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and expand my skillset.

My quick learning ability and adaptability allow me to seamlessly integrate into new teams and environments, while my problem-solving skills and attention to detail ensure that I deliver high-quality work.

I'm driven by a desire to constantly improve myself and contribute to impactful projects. Whether it's building innovative features or optimizing existing systems, I'm always up for a challenge.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and exploring exciting opportunities!
